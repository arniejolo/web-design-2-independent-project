    <h2>Publication</h2>
    <img src="" alt="A manual on how to make a rocking horse">
    <p>We are well-rounded in design for different types of publications from books, newsletters, infographics and manuals. Hurdlin’ Henry is a manual that was made for a rocking horse sold at Lowe’s. The objective of the manual was to be clear and concise with imagery and layout while having a playfulness as it is a toy targeted to young children.

    <h2>Illustration</h2>
    <img src="" alt="A symbol of Sun Tzu">
    <p>Illustration is a big part of our design process, and we include our original illustrations as much as possible. This logo of Sun Tzu started off with research, sketches and an idea of how to incorporate the timely era that Sun Tzu lived in.
